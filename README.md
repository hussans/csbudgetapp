**Description**: This budget app helps you track your money easily on phones and computers. Set your total budget, add expenses (like "Groceries" or "Bills"), and delete them if needed. It automatically updates your remaining budget and shows spending progress with a simple bar. Your data saves automatically—even if you close the browser—so it’s ready when you return. Designed to work smoothly on all screen sizes, it uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without complicated tools. Add expenses, watch your totals adjust, and stay on budget effortlessly.
